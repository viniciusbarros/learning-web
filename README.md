#Learning - A small guide for beginner web developers

This is a simple tutorial to guide and help beginner web developers who doesn't know where to start.
This document is separated in main topics with two sections inside: **Questions** and **Tasks**.

I recommend you start by answering all theoric questions before starting doing the tasks.

By the end of each module you will have sufficient knowledge to get deeper into that topic and learn more advanced techniques by yourself.
